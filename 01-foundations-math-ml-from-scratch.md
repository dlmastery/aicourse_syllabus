# Subject 01 — Math & ML Foundations From Scratch

**Track:** Foundations · **Altitude:** Learner · **Length:** 10 weeks (2 lecture hrs + 3 lab hrs/wk)
**Prerequisites:** programming in any language; high-school algebra. No prior ML.
**Pedagogy:** Vizuara-style *build-every-component-without-libraries* + the source book's
*concept → code → critique → reflection → rebuild* loop. You will not `import sklearn` until Week 6,
and only after you have re-implemented the same thing in NumPy.

**Course anchor case (carried all 10 weeks):** *delivery-time prediction* — predict how many minutes
a food-delivery order will take, from distance, item count, and weather. A second case,
*support-ticket urgency* (low/high), is introduced for classification. Both are reused so every new
idea lands on familiar ground.

**What you leave with:** a personal `ml-foundations/` repo containing a from-scratch math library, a
hand-coded neural layer, five reusable skills, and an evidence log — not a folder of finished notebooks.

## Week 1 — Why Math Is the Operating Language of ML (and Python/NumPy From Scratch)

**Altitude:** Learner · **Format:** 2h lecture + 3h lab
**Anchor case:** load the raw delivery-time CSV and compute a "predict the mean" baseline by hand.

### Learning goals
- Explain why ML is a set of *loops* (train→evaluate→inspect→revise) rather than a one-shot calculation.
- Implement matrix–vector multiplication in pure Python with no libraries, then in NumPy, and explain the speedup.
- Set up a reproducible repo (`venv`/`uv`, pinned deps, seeded RNG, `data/`, `src/`, `evidence/`).
- State the difference between a *prompt*, a *workflow*, a *skill*, and a *harness* (the book's ladder).

### Concept map
- **ML as iterative improvement.** Plain English: a model is a guess machine you correct with data.
  Where it matters: it reframes "learning" as optimization. Common mistake: expecting a closed-form answer.
- **The data matrix `X` and target `y`.** *Formula:* `X ∈ ℝ^{n×d}`, `y ∈ ℝ^{n}`. *Symbols:* `n`=rows/examples,
  `d`=features/columns. *Shapes:* one order = one row of `d` numbers. *Plain English:* a spreadsheet where
  rows are orders and columns are measurements. *Tiny example:* 3 orders × 3 features. *Code mapping:*
  `X = np.array([[3.1,2,1],[1.2,1,0],...])`. *Common mistake:* transposing `X` and silently training on garbage.
- **Matrix multiplication.** Why it matters: every model prediction is `X @ w`. The from-scratch lab makes the
  triple-loop cost visceral before NumPy hides it.
- **Reproducibility as a precondition for learning anything.** A result you can't re-run is not evidence.

### Hands-on build (the lab)
- `matmul.py`: implement `matmul(A, B)` with nested Python loops; unit-test it against `np.dot`; benchmark
  both on 200×200 matrices and record the ratio in `evidence/week01-bench.md`.
- `baseline.py`: load `delivery.csv`, predict the training mean for every row, compute mean absolute error (MAE).
- Initialize the repo with a seeded RNG and a `README` describing the anchor case.
- **Deliverable:** repo that runs `python baseline.py` and prints a baseline MAE.
  **Acceptance:** matmul matches NumPy to 1e-9; baseline MAE reported with units (minutes).

### Harness / reusable skill — `$study-harness`
- **Purpose:** turn any new concept into a reusable 7-step study loop.
- **Inputs:** one topic (e.g., "matrix multiplication"). **Required outputs:** simple explanation, formal
  statement, one counterexample, your own restatement, a tiny built artifact, one recorded mistake, one open question.
- **Minimal workflow:** explain → formalize → counterexample → rebuild in code → log. **Evidence artifact:**
  `evidence/study-log.md` with three columns: prediction / result / revision.

### Common failure modes
- **Library-first blindness** → you call `np.dot` and never learn what it does. *Fix:* implement once by hand.
- **Unseeded randomness** → results change every run, so nothing is comparable. *Fix:* seed everything, commit the seed.
- **No baseline** → you can't tell whether later models help. *Fix:* always ship the "predict the mean" number first.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week01-bench.md` (matmul correctness + timing) and the baseline MAE line committed to git.

### Skill sink-in
Before benchmarking, **predict** how much slower pure-Python matmul is than NumPy. Run it. Record the **result**
and what **changed** in your mental model of "why NumPy exists."

### Readings & sources (2025–2026)
- Source book, Ch. 1 (harness engineering) and Ch. 2 (math as operational language).
- Vizuara, *ML & DL Research Bootcamp* — "matrix multiplication without libraries."
- 3Blue1Brown, *Essence of Linear Algebra* (Ch. 1–3) for intuition.

## Week 2 — Linear Algebra as Shapes You Can Reason About

**Altitude:** Learner · **Anchor case:** batch-predict delivery times for all orders at once with one matrix op.

### Learning goals
- Read any ML equation as **shapes flowing through operations** and predict output dimensions before running.
- Explain dot product, matrix–vector, and matrix–matrix products geometrically and in code.
- Use broadcasting deliberately (and catch the bugs it hides).

### Concept map
- **Vector as one structured example.** *Formula:* `x ∈ ℝ^d`. *Plain English:* one order's measurements.
  *Common mistake:* treating a feature vector as a bag of unrelated numbers.
- **Linear prediction.** *Formula:* `ŷ = x·w + b`. *Symbols:* `w∈ℝ^d` weights, `b` bias. *Shapes:* `(d)·(d)→scalar`.
  *Code mapping:* `yhat = X @ w + b`. *Common mistake:* shape mismatch between `(n,d)` and `(d,)`.
- **Norms and distance.** Why it matters: nearest-neighbors and scaling are *geometry*; `‖a−b‖` is similarity.
- **Broadcasting.** Where it matters: subtracting a per-feature mean. Common mistake: accidental `(n,n)` blow-ups.

### Hands-on build
- Extend the math library: `dot`, `matvec`, `l2_norm`, `standardize(X)` — all from scratch, all unit-tested vs NumPy.
- Re-express Week 1's loop-based baseline as a single vectorized expression; confirm identical output.
- **Deliverable:** `linalg.py` + tests. **Acceptance:** vectorized delivery prediction equals the looped version.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$shape-checker`
- **Purpose:** annotate every line of model code with the shape of its result.
- **Inputs:** a code snippet. **Outputs:** the same snippet with `# (n, d)` shape comments and one predicted failure.
- **Evidence artifact:** a shape-annotated version of `linalg.py`.

### Common failure modes
- **Shape blindness** → silent broadcasting produces wrong-but-runnable results. *Fix:* annotate shapes, assert them.
- **Geometry amnesia** → distances computed on unscaled features. *Fix:* standardize first, justify why.
- **Transpose roulette** → guessing `.T` until it runs. *Fix:* derive the shape on paper first.

### Evidence artifact
Shape-annotated `linalg.py` and a one-paragraph note: "three bugs broadcasting could have hidden here."

### Skill sink-in
Predict the output shape of `X @ w` for `X:(100,3)`, `w:(3,)`. Run. Then break it on purpose and record the error.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 2 (vectors/matrices/shape literacy). Cornell CS4782 (linear-algebra refresher).
- Vizuara linear-algebra module; Gilbert Strang, *Linear Algebra* lectures (selected).

## Week 3 — Derivatives, Gradients & the Seed of Backpropagation

**Altitude:** Learner · **Anchor case:** measure how delivery-MAE changes as you nudge one weight.

### Learning goals
- Explain a derivative as "sensitivity of output to a small input change," numerically and symbolically.
- Compute a gradient by hand for a 2-feature linear model and verify it with finite differences.
- Explain why the gradient points uphill and why we step against it.

### Concept map
- **Derivative.** *Formula:* `f'(x)=lim_{h→0}(f(x+h)−f(x))/h`. *Plain English:* slope right here.
  *Tiny example:* `f(x)=x²`, `f'(3)=6`. *Code mapping:* finite-difference check. *Common mistake:* confusing
  the value `f(x)` with its rate of change `f'(x)`.
- **Partial derivative & gradient.** *Formula:* `∇f = [∂f/∂w₁, …, ∂f/∂w_d]`. *Shapes:* gradient has the same
  shape as the parameter. *Common mistake:* a gradient with the wrong shape silently breaks updates.
- **Chain rule.** Why it matters: it *is* backpropagation. Plain English: multiply local slopes along the path.

### Hands-on build
- `grads.py`: analytic gradient of squared-error loss for linear regression; `numerical_grad()` finite-difference
  checker; assert they agree to 1e-6 — this "gradient check" is the single most useful debugging habit in the course.
- **Deliverable:** passing gradient check on the delivery model. **Acceptance:** max abs diff < 1e-6.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$gradient-check`
- **Purpose:** never trust a hand-derived gradient without a numerical check.
- **Inputs:** a loss function + analytic gradient. **Outputs:** pass/fail + the worst-offending parameter.
- **Evidence artifact:** `evidence/week03-gradcheck.md`.

### Common failure modes
- **Sign errors** → model diverges. *Fix:* gradient-check before training.
- **Optimization mysticism** → treating gradient descent as magic. *Fix:* watch the loss decrease step by step.
- **Shape-mismatched gradients** → broadcasting "fixes" them into nonsense. *Fix:* assert `grad.shape == param.shape`.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week03-gradcheck.md` with the analytic-vs-numerical table.

### Skill sink-in
Predict whether increasing the distance-weight raises or lowers predicted delivery time, then verify via the gradient sign.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 2 (derivatives/gradients/optimization). Vizuara "backprop by hand" (chain rule).
- Stanford CS231n notes on gradients/backprop (still the clearest treatment).

## Week 4 — Probability & Statistics: The Language of Uncertainty

**Altitude:** Learner · **Anchor case:** ticket-urgency as a *probability*, not a hard label.

### Learning goals
- Use distributions, expectation, and variance to describe data and predictions.
- Explain maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and connect it to loss functions.
- Read a probabilistic claim ("the model is 80% confident") and say what it does and does not mean.

### Concept map
- **Random variable, distribution, expectation.** Plain English: a number that varies + how often each value
  appears + its long-run average. Common mistake: confusing a probability with a frequency in small samples.
- **Conditional probability & Bayes.** *Formula:* `P(y|x)=P(x|y)P(y)/P(x)`. Where it matters: classification is
  estimating `P(y|x)`. Common mistake: ignoring base rates (the fraud/medical-test fallacy).
- **MLE → loss.** Why it matters: minimizing cross-entropy *is* maximizing likelihood; squared error *is* a
  Gaussian-noise assumption. This single bridge demystifies "where loss functions come from."
- **Variance & noise.** Plain English: not all error is the model's fault; some is irreducible.

### Hands-on build
- `stats.py`: sample from distributions, estimate mean/variance, build a histogram from scratch.
- Derive on paper that minimizing squared error = MLE under Gaussian noise; reproduce numerically.
- **Deliverable:** a short `evidence/week04-mle.md` showing the squared-error↔Gaussian equivalence.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$uncertainty-reader`
- **Purpose:** translate any probabilistic output into plain-English meaning + one base-rate caution.
- **Inputs:** a predicted probability + context. **Outputs:** interpretation, what it ignores, one failure case.

### Common failure modes
- **Deterministic thinking** → treating 0.51 and 0.99 as the same "positive." *Fix:* keep probabilities, set thresholds deliberately.
- **Base-rate neglect** → high accuracy on rare events that's actually useless. *Fix:* always report the positive rate.
- **Confusing confidence with correctness.** *Fix:* calibration, introduced in Week 8.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week04-mle.md` (loss-from-likelihood derivation + numeric check).

### Skill sink-in
Predict whether a 90%-accurate ticket classifier is "good" when only 5% of tickets are urgent. Compute. Revise.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 2 (probability) and Ch. 17 (likelihood/GLM lineage). Vizuara probability/stats module.
- MIT 6.7960 / CS229 probability review notes.

## Week 5 — The Learning Problem: Loss, Empirical Risk & Gradient Descent From Scratch

**Altitude:** Learner→Builder · **Anchor case:** train the delivery model by gradient descent, watching the loss curve.

### Learning goals
- State empirical risk minimization and why it's a *proxy* for the real objective.
- Implement full-batch and mini-batch gradient descent from scratch.
- Diagnose learning-rate problems from the loss curve alone.

### Concept map
- **Empirical risk.** *Formula:* `R̂(w)=(1/n)Σ L(ŷᵢ,yᵢ)`. Plain English: average wrongness on your data.
  Common mistake: forgetting it's only a sample of the world (Week 9's generalization gap).
- **Gradient descent.** *Formula:* `w ← w − η∇R̂(w)`. *Symbols:* `η`=learning rate. *Plain English:* step downhill.
  *Common mistake:* `η` too large (diverge) or too small (crawl).
- **Mini-batch / SGD.** Why it matters: noise helps and scales. The bridge to deep learning in Subject 02.

### Hands-on build
- `gd.py`: train linear regression on delivery data with your own GD loop; log loss per epoch; plot the curve.
- Sweep three learning rates; save a *stable* run log and a *diverging* run log side by side.
- **Deliverable:** loss-curve plot + two run logs. **Acceptance:** stable run beats the Week 1 baseline MAE.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$training-diagnostics`
- **Purpose:** read a loss curve and rank the likely causes of bad training.
- **Inputs:** a loss log. **Outputs:** diagnosis (LR too high/low, bug, data issue) + the cheapest next experiment.
- **Evidence artifact:** annotated stable-vs-unstable logs.

### Common failure modes
- **Learning-rate guessing** → blame the model for an optimizer problem. *Fix:* sweep LR, read the curve.
- **No loss logging** → flying blind. *Fix:* log every epoch, plot it.
- **Beating no baseline** → "it trained" but is worse than the mean. *Fix:* compare to Week 1 always.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week05-training/` with loss plot + stable/unstable logs + a 5-line diagnosis note.

### Skill sink-in
Predict which of three learning rates will diverge before running the sweep. Record outcome and revision.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 2 (optimization) and Ch. 7 (training dynamics). Vizuara optimizers (GD/RMSProp/Adam) preview.

## Week 6 — First Models I: Linear & Logistic Regression (Now With, Then Without, scikit-learn)

**Altitude:** Builder · **Anchor case:** delivery time (regression) and ticket urgency (classification).

### Learning goals
- Implement and interpret linear and logistic regression; read coefficients responsibly.
- Explain the sigmoid and cross-entropy loss, and why logistic regression outputs calibrated-ish probabilities.
- Use `scikit-learn` *after* matching it with your from-scratch version.

### Concept map
- **Linear regression** — already built; now interpret weights as "minutes per km," with the caveat that
  correlation ≠ effect. Common mistake: causal language for a predictive coefficient.
- **Logistic regression.** *Formula:* `p=σ(x·w+b)`, `σ(z)=1/(1+e^{−z})`. *Plain English:* squash a score into a
  probability. *Code mapping:* `p = 1/(1+np.exp(-(X@w+b)))`. *Common mistake:* thresholding at 0.5 by default.
- **Cross-entropy loss.** Why it matters: the right loss for probabilities (from Week 4's MLE bridge).
- **Regularization (L1/L2).** Plain English: prefer simpler explanations. Where it matters: prevents overfitting (Week 9).

### Hands-on build
- `logreg.py` from scratch (sigmoid + cross-entropy + GD), gradient-checked; then reproduce with `sklearn` and
  confirm coefficients match within tolerance.
- **Deliverable:** both implementations + a coefficient-comparison table. **Acceptance:** agreement within 1e-2.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$baseline-builder`
- **Purpose:** for any new dataset, propose the simplest reasonable baseline + evaluation plan before any complex model.
- **Inputs:** dataset + target. **Outputs:** naive baseline, first interpretable model, metric, critical slices,
  one reason a complex model is *not yet* justified. **Evidence artifact:** a baseline memo.

### Common failure modes
- **Skipping the baseline** → no yardstick. **Interpretability-as-weakness** → discarding a strong simple model.
  **Default-threshold reflex** → 0.5 when costs are asymmetric. **Causal overclaim** from coefficients.
  *Fixes:* baseline first; earn complexity; choose thresholds by cost; say "associated with," not "causes."

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week06-baseline-memo.md` for both cases.

### Skill sink-in
Predict which feature gets the largest logistic weight for ticket urgency; fit; compare; explain the surprise.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 4 (first models). CS229 (GLMs/logistic). Vizuara regression module (sigmoid/cross-entropy/regularization).

## Week 7 — First Models II: Trees, Ensembles & Strong Baselines

**Altitude:** Builder · **Anchor case:** fraud screening — where a "flashy" model is *not* the lesson.

### Learning goals
- Explain decision trees (splits, impurity, depth) and why they suit tabular data.
- Compare majority / logistic / single-tree / random-forest / gradient-boosted on one task with one metric.
- Read feature importance without overclaiming, and spot leakage.

### Concept map
- **Decision tree.** Plain English: a flowchart of yes/no questions. *Split criterion:* Gini/entropy.
  Common mistake: deep trees memorize. **Pruning / max-depth** as the fix.
- **Bagging / Random Forest.** Why it matters: averaging many decorrelated trees reduces variance.
- **Boosting (gradient boosting / XGBoost-style).** Plain English: each tree fixes the previous one's mistakes.
- **Feature importance.** Helpful but narrow and easy to abuse. **Leakage** — the shortcut that lies.

### Hands-on build
- Implement a small decision tree from scratch (Gini, max-depth); then use `sklearn`/`xgboost` for forest & boosting.
- One comparison table: majority, logistic, tree, forest, boosted — with the same metric and split.
- **Deliverable:** comparison table + a slice analysis showing where tree models win (e.g., new-device cross-border).
  **Acceptance:** a justified recommendation, not just "boosting won."

### Harness / reusable skill — `$tabular-model-review`
- **Purpose:** honest structured-data model comparison. **Inputs:** dataset + candidate models.
  **Outputs:** split strategy, slice comparison, leakage notes, calibration concern, justified pick.

### Common failure modes
- **Deep-model prestige** · **single-metric triumph** · **feature-importance overclaim** · **hidden-leakage success** ·
  **baseline shame**. *Fixes:* compare honestly; report several metrics; treat importance as a hint; audit for leakage;
  never be embarrassed to ship a simple winner.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week07-model-comparison.md` (table + slice table + recommendation).

### Skill sink-in
Predict which model wins the rare fraud slice before running; compare; record what changed your mind.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 5 (trees/ensembles). CS181/CS229 (boosting/ensembles). Vizuara decision-trees module.

## Week 8 — Evaluation, Error Analysis & Experiment Design

**Altitude:** Builder→Engineer · **Anchor case:** is the new fraud model *actually* better?

### Learning goals
- Choose metrics that match the decision (MAE vs F1 vs precision/recall vs AUC) and explain what each hides.
- Run a threshold sweep and a slice analysis; reason about calibration.
- Design an honest experiment (train/val/test, no leakage, one variable at a time).

### Concept map
- **Metric–decision fit.** Plain English: the metric must reward the behavior you actually want.
  Common mistake: optimizing AUC when the deployed threshold is what matters.
- **Threshold sweep.** Why it matters: one model is many classifiers depending on the cutoff.
- **Slices.** Where it matters: averages hide the failures that get you fired (new merchants, rare classes).
- **Calibration.** Plain English: when it says 0.8, is it right 80% of the time?

### Hands-on build
- `eval.py`: confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1, ROC/PR, a threshold sweep CSV, and a per-slice error table.
- Write a one-page evaluation review note deciding whether the experiment supports "the new model is better."
- **Deliverable:** threshold-sweep CSV + slice table + review note. **Acceptance:** the note names at least one
  thing the headline metric hides.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$evaluation-review`
- **Purpose:** review any result for what the main metric hides, threshold/calibration issues, critical slices,
  and whether the evidence supports the claim. **Evidence artifact:** the review note.

### Common failure modes
- **Benchmark vanity** (a metric with no comparison/limitation) · **leakage by convenient split** · **slice blindness** ·
  **metric worship before framing**. *Fixes:* metric+comparison+limitation together; time-aware splits; always slice.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week08-eval/` (sweep CSV, slice table, review note).

### Skill sink-in
Predict the precision at the recall you need *before* sweeping the threshold; sweep; revise the deployment recommendation.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 6 (evaluation/error analysis). CMU 11-711 "Evaluation Techniques." Krish Naik (LLM-as-judge preview).

## Week 9 — Bias, Variance, Regularization & Generalization (Learning-Theory Intuition)

**Altitude:** Builder→Engineer · **Anchor case:** a model with great training error and a useless test error.

### Learning goals
- Explain the train/val/test split and why low training error is not the ending.
- Diagnose under- vs over-fitting from learning curves; apply regularization and early stopping.
- State capacity / VC-style intuition in plain language (no theorems required).

### Concept map
- **Empirical vs population risk.** Plain English: your data is a sample; the world is the test.
- **Bias–variance.** Plain English: too simple (misses signal) vs too flexible (memorizes noise).
- **Capacity / VC intuition.** Where it matters: more capacity needs more data or more regularization.
  Common mistake: treating a benchmark number as truth without asking about the split.
- **Regularization & early stopping** as capacity control.

### Hands-on build
- `generalization_lab.py`: fit polynomials of increasing degree to the delivery data; plot train vs val error;
  find the overfitting point; add L2 and watch the gap close.
- **Deliverable:** a train-vs-validation curve + a short theory note. **Acceptance:** you can point to the exact
  capacity where validation error turns up.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$generalization-translator`
- **Purpose:** translate learning-theory language (capacity, uniform convergence, VC) into a practical lesson +
  one misuse to avoid. **Evidence artifact:** the theory note.

### Common failure modes
- **Training-error celebration** · **capacity denial** · **theory misuse** (quoting VC bounds as if practical).
  *Fixes:* judge on held-out data; match capacity to data; use theory for intuition, not false precision.

### Evidence artifact
`evidence/week09-generalization/` (curve + note).

### Skill sink-in
Predict the polynomial degree where validation error bottoms out; run the sweep; record the gap.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 18–19 (inductive bias, generalization/VC). CS229 learning-theory notes. Cornell CS4782 (regularization).

## Week 10 — Capstone: A From-Scratch ML Project With an Evidence Packet

**Altitude:** Builder (graduating to Subject 02) · **Anchor case:** your choice of a small real tabular dataset.

### Learning goals
- Run the full loop on a new dataset: frame → baseline → model → evaluate → critique → rebuild.
- Produce an **evidence packet** that proves judgment, not just a final score.
- Reuse the five skills built this course as a coherent personal harness.

### Concept map (review as a checklist)
- Problem framing (what decision? what's the prediction moment? what would leakage look like?).
- Baseline discipline → model comparison → honest evaluation → generalization check.

### Hands-on build
- Pick a dataset (e.g., California Housing or a Fashion-MNIST subset, per Vizuara's capstones, or your own).
- Ship: framing memo, baseline, ≥3 models compared, threshold/slice evaluation, generalization curve, and a
  written "what I would do next and why." **Deliverable:** `capstone/` folder + 2-page report.
  **Acceptance:** every claim in the report points to a file in the evidence packet.

### Harness / reusable skill — `$project-evidence-packet`
- **Purpose:** assemble framing memo + baseline + comparison + eval note + generalization note into one
  reviewable bundle. **Evidence artifact:** the packet itself (this *is* the deliverable).

### Common failure modes
- **Score-only reporting** (no evidence trail) · **skipping framing** · **no next-step reasoning**.
  *Fixes:* link every claim to a file; frame before modeling; end with a defended next experiment.

### Evidence artifact
`capstone/` with all artifacts + the 2-page report.

### Skill sink-in
Before the final run, write down the test metric you expect. Compare. The gap between expectation and result is the
real lesson — record it.

### Readings & sources
- Source book Ch. 16 (turning projects into evidence) and Appendix A (capstone blueprints).
- Vizuara capstones (Fashion MNIST, California Housing). Krish Naik end-to-end project structure (for the deployment preview into Subject 09).

### W1 — matmul & baseline · weight 5%
- **Dataset:** `delivery.csv` (synthetic, provided; ~500 rows: `distance_km, item_count, is_raining, minutes`; CC0).
```python
